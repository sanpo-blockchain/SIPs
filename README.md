# Sanpō Improvement Proposals (SIPs)
SIPs are system design document for new functions provided to the Sampō community.
SIP should state the purpose of the new feature and a concise technical specification and rationale for the specification.
SIP proponents are responsible for explaining their content to the community, collecting opinions, and documenting any objections or alternative methods.

The SIP aims to be an open improvement mechanism for Sanpō, proposing new features to Sanpō, gathering technical opinions of the community on how to solve known problems, and being an open improvement mechanism for Sanpō.
SIPs are kept as text files in GitHub repositories, so their revision history serves as a historical record of feature proposals. This will allow Sampō's engineers and users to understand the technical implementation status of Sampō and track its history.

SIP-1 mention how SIPs are published.
